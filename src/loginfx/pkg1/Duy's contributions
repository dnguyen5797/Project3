I designed and created the tabs and their functionality in ADMINFXML.fxml if the admin
were to sign in. There is a test tab where we could use as a possible tab design if we wanted to change
to that design. In the test lab there will be a list view of the usernames and passwords along with
an 'Add' or 'Delete' button which will redirect the admin to another scene to enter their desired add/delete.
When an admin logs in a file will automatically be read which will hold the usernames and passwords to
either the warehouse manager, office manager, or sale associate. Upon logging out the file changes will be
saved to the file that was opened.
